# React Hooks Example

This is a simple React application demonstrating the use of React Hooks. React Hooks are a new addition to React that allow you to use state and lifecycle features in functional components, making them a powerful tool for modern React development.

This project covers several core hooks including:

- `useState`: For managing state in functional components.
- `useEffect`: For performing side effects in functional components.
- `useContext`: For using context API with functional components.
- `useReducer`: For more complex state management in functional components.
- `useRef`: For accessing DOM elements and keeping mutable variables.

## Features

- **State Management with `useState`**: Demonstrates how to use the `useState` hook to manage component state.
- **Side Effects with `useEffect`**: Shows how to use the `useEffect` hook for operations like fetching data, subscribing to external data sources, and cleaning up side effects.
- **Context with `useContext`**: Illustrates how to share state across components with the `useContext` hook.
- **Complex State with `useReducer`**: Demonstrates how to use `useReducer` for managing more complex state.
- **Refs with `useRef`**: Shows how to directly reference DOM elements using `useRef`.

## Tech Stack

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React Hooks**: Modern React feature to use state and other React features in functional components.
- **CSS Modules**: Scoped CSS for styling individual components.
